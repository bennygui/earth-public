This is the implementation of Earth for BGA:

This is a copy of the original private repository, stripped of images to
prevent any copyright problems. I will try to update it when the main
repository changes.

This is my fourth game on BGA and is much more organised, with BX being a
general library that will be reusable in future games.

This matches version 230525-1312 on BGA.
